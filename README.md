# Face-and-License-Plate-Detection-using-Computer-Vision
This project leverages computer vision techniques to automatically detect human faces and vehicle license plates from images and live video streams. It combines multiple object detection algorithms to identify both types of entities simultaneously, making it useful for applications in surveillance, law enforcement, and automated access control.

The core objective of the project was to explore the application of Haar Cascade Classifiers for real-time object detection using OpenCV. A webcam or video feed is used as input, where the system identifies and highlights both facial features and license plate numbers within the same frame. The project includes well-commented Python scripts and can be run with minimal configuration.
